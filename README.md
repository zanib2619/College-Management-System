# College-Management-System
# College Management System Database

This project is a basic implementation of a relational database schema for a College Management System using SQL. It covers the creation of tables for students, courses, and enrollments, along with appropriate keys and relationships.

## ðŸ“š Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to design a well-structured schema that demonstrates:

* Creating a database and tables
* Using primary and foreign keys
* Establishing relationships between entities


This project is part of my learning and internship submission, aimed at demonstrating my understanding of database design concepts.

* **Courses**: Contains course information
* **Enrollments**: Records which students are enrolled in which courses

## ðŸ’» SQL Script

```sql
-- Create the database
CREATE DATABASE College;
USE College;

-- Create Students table
CREATE TABLE Students (
    StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    Email VARCHAR(60) UNIQUE,
    DOB DATE
);

-- Create Courses table
CREATE TABLE Courses (
    CourseID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CourseName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    Credits INT CHECK (Credits > 0)
);

-- Create Enrollments table
CREATE TABLE Enrollments (
    EnrollmentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    StudentID INT,
    CourseID INT,
    EnrollmentDate DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (StudentID) REFERENCES Students(StudentID),
    FOREIGN KEY (CourseID) REFERENCES Courses(CourseID)
);
